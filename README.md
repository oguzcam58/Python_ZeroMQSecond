# Python_ZeroMQSecond
It is a school project, server has some functions (add-subtract-multiply-divide) and client uses it with sending arguments and server replies with the result after completing the computation. Two integer arguments are expected.
REQ/REP was used for this project.

To Run the application, python and zeromq should be installed on your mac or Windows. Open a terminal and run server.py first, then run client.py.
You should follow client.py instructions and push "enter" after every entry, it goes to server and server strikes back with the result of operation. Client shows it on the screen.

This is a project for a heating-up with zeromq, nothing more.
